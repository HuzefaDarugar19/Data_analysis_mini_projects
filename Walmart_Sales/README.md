🛒 Walmart Sales Analysis – Business Insights from Real Retail Data This project is a deep-dive analysis of Walmart sales data, aiming to uncover actionable business insights and provide strategic solutions through data-driven decision making.

Using a dataset sourced from Kaggle, I approached this analysis like a professional data analyst working in a retail environment — exploring, visualising, and solving real-world business challenges.

📊 Objectives & Approach ✅ Data Cleaning & Preparation: Ensured accuracy and consistency for meaningful insights.

✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Uncovered trends across time, store types, and departments.

✅ Business Problem Solving: Tackled key questions such as:

Which store generates the highest revenue?

How do sales vary during holiday periods?

What is the effect of fuel prices, CPI, and unemployment on sales?

Are markdown strategies working effectively?

Which months bring in the most revenue?

✅ Strategic Insights:

Highlighted store-specific performance and suggested targeted actions.

Identified seasonal and economic factors influencing sales.

Recommended data-backed improvements in markdown strategies.

🧠 Skills Demonstrated 📌 Advanced data wrangling (Pandas, NumPy)

📌 Visual storytelling (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Power BI)

📌 Business thinking & domain understanding

📌 Answering real-world business questions with clarity and confidence

💡 Why This Project Stands Out This isn’t just a sales report — it’s a business case study. I’ve analysed the data, extracted the insights, and proposed practical solutions that a retail analyst or business manager could act upon.

Every chart, every insight, and every line of code was written with a business-first mindset — and it took a great deal of thought and effort to reach this level of clarity.

📁 Dataset Available on Kaggle: [Insert link if public] Columns include: Date, Weekly_Sales, Store, Holiday_Flag, Temperature, Fuel_Price, CPI, Unemployment, etc.

⚡ If you're a recruiter or collaborator, this project reflects my ability to connect technical skills with business value. I’m always open to feedback and opportunities to grow.
